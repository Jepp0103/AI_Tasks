Assignments Linear regression: 

Assignment 7: 
Try change the hyper parameters for our first gradient descent implementation, and try to answer these questions:

How many iterations are necessary to get a good result?
1206 iterations.

What is the smallest and largest values of alpha that works well?
Alpha =  0.06 (smallest amount of iterations)
Alpha = 0.01 (highest amount of iterations)

What influence does different values of theta have?
It changes a (the coefficient)  and b (starting point)

Assignment 8

How many iterations are necessary to get a good approximation?

How much bigger is the error at that point than doing 5000 iterations?
